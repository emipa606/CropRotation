    <content>This update adds automatic crop-rotation to growing zones.
After harvesting a crop, pawns will sow the next available crop selected.
The automatic rotation is only available on zones where the base crop is a harvestable plant and not a tree.</content>

    <content>This update adds multiple changes that can all be changed in the mod-options.
There is now two research-projects for the auto-rotation. Basic for rotation between two crops, advanced between any amount of crops.
A new option for requiring three crop-rotation for yield to increase while two only stops it from lowering.
A new option for rotation to just lowering the yield at half the rate of not rotating.
A new option to let yield improve by burning crops, letting some percent of their current growth get added to the yield-calculations for the following crops.
A new option to make yield improve over time if no crop is sown, up to the normal 100%.
Also added information to the growing-zone info to show the average yield-modifier for the zone.

Thank you for all suggestions, makes this mod fun to expand upon!</content>

    <date>2023/8/14</date>
    <content>There is now a controlled way to start crop-fires to increase yield.
The growing zone will now have a Burn Crops gizmo that will cause a pawn to come over and set the field on fire.
They will then stay and watch the fire to not let it spread outside of the field.</content>

    <date>2023/8/16</date>
    <content>It is now possible to switch a zone to seasonal sowing.
You can select a different crop for each season.
The map can of course not have permanent summer/winter for this option to be available.
It is also locked behind the same research as the multi-rotation of crops.</content>
