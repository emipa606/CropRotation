Planting the same crop over and over is fine in Rimworld but in real life this causes issues. 
The soil looses its fertility and pests and diseases happily make themselves a permanent home as their preferred food source is guaranteed.
Crop rotation helps return nutrients to the soil without synthetic inputs.

This mod lowers the yield of crops when the same crop is planted in the same spot multiple times. 
The yield gets lower and lower each time, but rotating the crop instead increases the yield.
This only affects plants in growing-zones that are destroyed upon harvesting. 

Mod-options
[list]
[*]The amount to lower/increase the yield for each crop-iteration
[*]Maximum yield-multiplier
[*]Minimum yield-multiplier
[*]The amount of crop-iterations to take into account to calculate the yield
[/list]

I also was thinking of adding an extra gizmo to growing-zones to select an alternate crop. 
This would make pawn automatically switch between the crops when planting. 
If this sounds like something you would like me to add, please leave a comment!
